Exception thrown: bind: Address already in use
Signal 11 caught.

CommonUnixCrashHandler: Signal=11

Engine crash handling finished; re-raising signal 11 for the default handler. Good bye.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

â€» Cause: there are some carlar objects are running. You should kill them all and restart carla simulation again
ps -aux | grep carla
# Use the IDs displayed in the output of the last command. 
kill id  

Or you can restart Virtual Machine to fix this problem.
